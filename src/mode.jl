    ForwardMode

Trait for AD choices that rely on [forward mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Forward_accumulation) algorithmic differentiation or [finite differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).

These two paradigms are classified together because they can both efficiently compute Jacobian-vector products.

Trait for AD choices that rely on [reverse mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation) algorithmic differentiation.

"""
    ForwardOrReverseMode

Trait for AD choices that can work either in [`ForwardMode`](@ref) or [`ReverseMode`](@ref), depending on their configuration.

!!! warning
    This trait should rarely be used, because more precise dispatches to [`ForwardMode`](@ref) or [`ReverseMode`](@ref) should be defined.
